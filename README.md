# site-de-maths

This was a college project done just by me. This is my first project using JavaScript.

The project consists of creating a website to help people study mathematics in a simple way.

Website construction:

- Generate random numbers
- Show the random numbers to the user
- Compute user response with system response
- Show the user if the answer was correct or not.
- Score the user and show his maximum record
- Being able to add your name to the record, being saved in the browser.

Pros and cons :

I was able to easily do the JavaScript part even though it was the first time using it in a real project, because of my previous experiences it was not that difficult to develop a working system according to what I wanted. But I had difficulties with the CSS part, flexbox is still being an area of ​​study that I have to persist.
